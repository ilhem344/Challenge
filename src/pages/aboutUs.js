      Let’s face it, cocktails are delicious. Some have remained timelessly in
      vogue for hundreds of years, never becoming ‘Old Fashioned’, while some
      have faded into history (not many Flips in bars these days). New cocktails
      are constantly being created using more and more experimental techniques
      and exciting flavours, and the latest cocktail trends include the return
      of forgotten cocktails, variations on classics, draft cocktails and for
      the daring – savoury cocktails! Tales & Spirits One of Amsterdam’s most
      auspicious spots for innovative food and cocktails, the attentive and
      knowledgeable bartenders make you feel right at home in its classy, yet
      quirky interior.
